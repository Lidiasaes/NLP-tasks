# Sentiment_analysis

You will find different scripts to do sentiment/emotion analysis.

The files are usually named as: LLMname_dataset-used. 
I do not own any credits for this, most of these scripts are obtained by following **tutorials** in Youtube or general websites on Google. Any references are found in each file for more information.
