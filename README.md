# Sentiment_analysis

You will find different scripts to do sentiment/emotion analysis.

  The files are usually named as: task_LLMname_dataset-used. 

I do not own any credits for this, most of these scripts are obtained by following **tutorials** on Youtube or general websites on Google. Any references are to be found in each file for more information.
