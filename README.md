# NLP-TASKS

You will find different scripts to perform various tasks on the NLP domain. Mostly will be very basic scripts to use different libraries.

  The files are usually named as: task_LLMname_dataset-used, or task, if it has not been performed on a certain dataset. 

I do not own any credits for this, most of these scripts are obtained by following **tutorials** on Youtube, used Stackoverflow, Chat GPT, or general websites and documentation on Google. Any references are to be found in each file for more information.
